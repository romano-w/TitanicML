## Kaggle competition notebook and submission

This is the first of many competition entries on Kaggle. Since I was new to many of the involved techniques (analysis, data wrangling, model creation, submission) I borrowed heavily from [Comprehensive Data Exploration with Python](https://www.kaggle.com/pmarcelino/comprehensive-data-exploration-with-python) and [Titanic Data Science Solutions](https://www.kaggle.com/startupsci/titanic-data-science-solutions). My final score on this submission was 77%.
